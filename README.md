# Apunim: Attributing polarization to sociodemographic groups

Repository housing the implementation of the Aposteriori Unimodality (``Apunim'') metric, available as a PyPi module. See the accompanying paper for details: 
"Quantifying and Attributing Polarization to Annotator Groups" (link pending).

Includes two functions: `dfu`, which calculates the Distance From Unimodality (and also implements the normalized variant - nDFU), and `aposteriori-unimodality`, which calculates the apunim metric and associated pvalue. Install with ```pip install apunim```.

See the [online documentation](https://dimits-ts.github.io/apunim/) for high-level
notes, usage examples, and module documentation.
